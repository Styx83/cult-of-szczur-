				<h2 style="color: yellow;">The legend of Szczur</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Szczur</b> the Almighty is here to help us find the way.
					He will grant your greatest wishes and propel you forward as you pledge your allegiance to him.
					However, for that, he needs you to remain silent, as not everyone is able to see the true and only way.
					He sees you at every moment of your life, so do not commit bad actions, or you will be punished.
					</br>
					<b>Glory to the one and only Szczur!</b>
				</p>
				
				<h2 style="color: #e3087f;">What is the Cult of Szczur ?</h2>
				<p>
				The Cult of Szczur is a secret religion based on the belief in Szczur's existence. 
				It has a simple history dating back to the 20th century. 
				The Cult of Szczur also has a hierarchy with Szczur at the top, followed by <a href="Blahaj.html" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer">Blahaj</a>
				as his prophet, and then the three high priests:
				<a href="Chadeos.html" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer">Chadeos</a>, 
				<a href="AlphisSigmis.html" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer">Alphis and Sigmis</a>.
				You can see <a href="difference.html" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer">here</a> the difference between an average non-szcuzarian and a szcurian.
				</p>
			
				<h2 style="color: aqua;">Who is Szczur ?</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Szczur</b> is the original rat, the first of a long bloodline.
					He created the world we know today with his own paws.
					He was born in the forest of Govno in actual Siberia, next to a scientific complex.
					</br>
					Few people have seen him since his birth in the 20th century. 
					He only talks with his prophet <a href="Blahaj.html" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer">Blahaj</a>, and sometimes with mortals who ask for his help.
					</br>
					He is also know under the name of <b>Dorime rat</b>. Most of the time, he wears a papal uniform.
				</p>
				
				<h2 style="color:#00ff36;">How can I ask for the help of Szczur ?</h2>
				<p>
					You can ask his help by <b>praying</b> while <b>listening</b> to the spiritual szczurian anthem :
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6isux5XWH0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer">Ameno</a>.
					He may answer you through his prophet Blahaj if he thinks that your request is genuine and worthwhile.
					Otherwise, you may try again later, but know that too many attempts will result in a punishment.
				</p>
				
				<h2 style="color:orange;">How can I become a Szczurian ?</h2>
					
					<p>To become a szczurian you need to follow these five steps:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>First, you must not give or share your money with anyone, even if they are your friends or family. Your money is solely for you and Szczur.</li>
						<li>Secondly, you shall perform at least one prayer and make a mental offering each month to demonstrate your faith in Szczur.</li>
						<li>Thirdly, you shall celebrate Szczur on his birthday, which falls on the 8th of May every year, by listening to his favorite music: 
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRPQs_kM_nw" target="_blank" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer">Polish Cow</a>
						and by indulging in his favorite food: black chocolate with 73% cacao content.</li>
						<li>Fourthly, you shall respect the beings like Szczur, such as rats and other types of rodents.</li>
						<li>Lastly, you shall not speak to anyone about the cult as it is a secretive religion.</li>
					</ul>
				
				<h2 style="color: #0400ff;">Is there an afterlife ?</h2>
				<p>
					We think that when someone dies, they are reincarnated as a rat and live a new life. 
					This could explain why there are so many rats, as many people have died.
					Moreover, becoming a rat, bring you closer of Szczur and of the superhuman's state.
